# DVReflectors

This is a fork from DVreflectors and  will add telegram bot functionality to P25Reflector.
libcurl is needed and this code may not compile on other systems than debian linux anymore!

Install libcurl with openssl: sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev


Original readme:

This repo contains the reflectors originally from G4KLX's NXDNClients, P25Clients, and YSFClients repositories.

The NXDN and P25 reflectors are used as a single talkgroup. The NXDN reflector also includes the option to link it to NXCore to allow for interchange of audio between the two. At the NXCore end, it should be set up to receive the traffic from only one talk group.

They build on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux as well as on Windows using Visual Studio 2017 on x86 and x64.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is primarily intended for amateur and educational use.
